Basis and Merkle composite completion

Working with any Base cryptography wheel -which using OmniXX Key miner- maintains Threaded interior encryption, combined with interior sign locks when paired with a signing byte code encryption. With the current trend of the CryptoCoin, the Merkle tree has become a favorites basis of integrity continuity which when utilized connected to outside self signing procedures such as the standard of the HMAC3-SHA512 builds directly into more integral encryption. Following is the build Rulesets and visual Form listing for the initial bind and runtime build for a 3-Separation Coiner composition.

The build is placed in such a measure as a C# 4.6. Encryption wheel and divisional Merkle and coining, an Android NDK formset and applet APK, a MODx Server for HTTP direct access and the usage of api.domain.com as the api Proxy base.

While API washing in itself prevents loss of cryptography moderately, using a xPlatform accessor, a c# written and compiled interior encryption wheel, and API specific internal webapplication runtime signing between verified user APK applet and api.domain hosted applet for self Signing, Merkle build, token verification, and provision of string artifacts and TCP/IP or UDP concat data transport between 2-Part verifiers, especially with log-authentication for the APK from OAuth2 proxies, guarantees the absolute greatest level internally washed variables and exquisitely hard to hack components.


The Rulesets are law

And the glorrrrrryyyyy!!!!!!!!!

Utilized and produced in appropriate choreography the manifestation of the Rulesets above and a visual form basis of the actual APK provides ample ground for APK specific Heuristics and Data processing through TCP/IP or UDP encoded packets transfered through encoding separations and then divided into the capable Volume capacitors transported through and relocalized into temporary JSON veriables accessed, and filled for live usage able to be, and required to be, closed and Data disposed at the end of live functions prior to Completion closure. Which due to the implemented dual sign seal second by second by second provides the APK it’s third party security by verifiable Data locale usage receiving washed and isolated security in its own process and moment by moment difference from internal usage, encryption usage, API usage and app only String, numeral, and image basis having discarded non-functional Data sets prior to JSON local storage.

The ticking tablesets and Visual Form RunDown

Specifically designated in a visual form Base while all of the C# encryption is built direct in an Asynchronous and Interim heavy build basis for Access to synchronization separate code for UI built in xPlatform MODx connection hosting and xPlatform only APK pairing and isolated UI controllers, ALL elements remain secure.
